System should follow these steps:
  ✔ 1. Find matches' start and end point and declare a variable to receive the game data @done(22-06-16 20:25)
  ☐ 2. Pass each line of a match through a series of auxiliary functions to process users interactions and calculate kill counts
  ☐ 3. Return the game data and write a JSON file with the result

The log file contains the following trigger words:
  ✔ 1. InitGame @done(22-06-16 20:25)
  ✔ 2. ClientConnect @done(22-06-16 20:25)
  ✔ 3. ClientUserinfoChanged @done(22-06-16 20:25)
  ☐ 4. Kill

When reading each log line, the system should verify:
  ClientConnect:
    ✔ Was the player already logged in this match? @done(22-06-16 20:25)
  ClientUserinfoChanged:
    ✔ Does the player's name changed? @done(22-06-16 20:25)
    ✔ Does the player's name have spaces in it? @done(22-06-16 20:25)
  Kill:
    ✔ Is it a "player kill"? -> Add 1 to his/her killCount and to totalKillCount @done(22-06-16 21:23)
    ✔ Is it a "world kill"? -> Subtract 1 from his/her killCount and add 1 to totalKillCount @done(22-06-16 21:23)
    ✔ Did the player kill him/herself? -> Consider as a "world kill" = Subtract 1 from his/her killCount and add 1 to totalKillCount @done(22-06-16 21:23)

Player ranking:
  ☐ Iterate through count kills and create an array with the values (do not repeat values)
  ☐ Sort values in decreasing order
  ☐ Mount 'ranking' object with values as keys
  ☐ Add an array of users' name (for cases where more than one player got the same score) to each key
